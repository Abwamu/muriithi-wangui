# 📅 Master Timetable 2024/2025 (HTML & CSS)

This project is a **Master Timetable** for the academic year **2024/2025**, created using **HTML** for structure and **CSS** for styling.  
It was made as a beginner-friendly project to practice building web pages while also creating something useful for students and teachers.  

## 🖥️ Features
This timetable has several features that make it both practical and a good learning project:  

- ✅ **Clean Table Layout** → Days of the week and lesson times are neatly organized in rows and columns.  
- ✅ **Multiple Year Groups** → Covers **Year 7 to Year 11** in one timetable.  
- ✅ **Special Activities** → Includes school-wide sessions like **Devotion, Break, Lunch, Clubs, Games, and Mind Lecture**.  
- ✅ **Rowspan and Colspan** → Merges cells to show activities that apply to more than one class or time slot.  
- ✅ **Vertical Text** → Used for "Form Tutor’s Time" to save space and make the table look professional.  
- ✅ **Highlighted Breaks & Lunch** → Breaks and lunchtime are clearly separated from lessons so students can spot them easily.  
- ✅ **Teacher & Facilitator List** → Names of teachers/facilitators are provided at the bottom for easy reference.  
- ✅ **Readable Design** → CSS adds borders, colors, and spacing so the timetable is easy to read.  
- ✅ **Reusable Structure** → You can copy and edit the timetable to create new schedules for other years or terms.
